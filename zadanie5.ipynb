    "There are $n$ groups of friends, and each group is numbered from 1 to $n$. The $i^{th}$ group contains $a_i$ people.\n",
    "\n",
    "They live near a bus stop, and only a single bus operates on this route. An empty bus arrives at the bus stop and all the groups want to travel by the bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, group of friends do not want to get separated. So they enter the bus only if the bus can carry the entire group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the groups do not want to change their relative positioning while travelling. In other words, group 3 cannot travel by bus, unless group 1 and group 2 have either:\n",

    "\n",
    "If $x = 2$: No bus trip is possible. That's because $a_1$ cannot go alone, as one seat will be **left vacant** in the bus. And, $a_1$ & $a_2$ cannot go together, because the bus cannot accommodate both the groups simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $x = 3$: In the first trip, $a_1$ & $a_2$ go by the bus. In the second trip, $a_3$, $a_4$ & $a_5$ go by the bus. In the third trip, $a_6$ & $a_7$ go by the bus. In the fourth trip, $a_8$ go by the bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $x = 4$: In the first trip, $a_1$, $a_2$ & $a_3$ go by the bus. In the second trip, $a_4$, $a_5$ & $a_6$ go by the bus. In the third trip $a_7$ & $a_8$ go by the bus.\n",
